# k8s-event-logger

Subscribes to Kubernetes events, logging them to:

* STDOUT (default)
* Bugsnag (optional)
* Statsd (optional, dogstatsd)

## Getting Started

```
# make sure you have a Secret "bugsnag" with a key "api-key" whose value is your bugsnag API Key
make deploy
```

## Configuring

To enable Bugsnag reporting, set `BUGSNAG_API_KEY` in your ENV.
The included sample deployment YAML expects this to come from a Kubernetes secret, which you can create like so:

```
$ kubectl create secret generic bugsnag --from-literal=api-key=MYSECRETAPIKEY
```

To enable Statsd reporting, set `STATSD_URL` in your ENV.
The included sample deployment YAML expects this to be `statsd:8125` (you have a service named statsd running on UDP 8125).

## Permissions 

You have to create a service account in your cluster and grant permissions to it, in order to list and watch
events with the logger. To do so, create service account, clusterrole and binding as shown in the deploymnet folder in
this repo.
